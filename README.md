# NeuralMatrix
NeuroMatrixAnalyzer is a Python class that brings a neural network-inspired approach to matrix analysis. It aims to explore the stability and adaptability of neural weight matrices through advanced mathematical concepts like singularity checks and synaptic pruning. This tool is inspired by cognitive modeling, mirroring how biological neural networks adapt and evolve.

**🚀 Features**
Trainability Check: Ensures neural network stability by checking if the weight matrix is non-singular.
Synaptic Pruning: Mimics the biological process of pruning weak neural connections to enhance network efficiency.
Custom Exception Handling: Raises MatrixIsSingular exception for singular weight matrices, suggesting dropout or regularization as solutions.

**📂 Installation**
Make sure you have NumPy installed:
```python
pip install numpy

⚙️ Usage
1. Import and Initialize
```python
from NeuroMatrixAnalyzer import NeuroMatrixAnalyzer  

# Define your neural network's weight matrix  
weights = [[0.2, 0.5], [0.4, 0.1]]  

# Initialize NeuroMatrixAnalyzer  
analyzer = NeuroMatrixAnalyzer(weights)
2. Check Trainability
```python
# Check if the network is trainable  
trainability = analyzer.check_trainability()  
print(trainability)  # Output: "Stable network" or "Apply dropout or regularization"
3. Synaptic Pruning
```python
# Prune weak connections below the threshold of 0.1  
pruned_weights = analyzer.synaptic_pruning(threshold=0.1)  
print(pruned_weights)
🔍 How It Works
check\_trainability()
Uses the condition number to determine if the weight matrix is singular.
If the matrix is near-singular (high condition number), it raises MatrixIsSingular.
Suggests applying dropout or regularization to improve network stability.
synaptic\_pruning()
Sets weights below a certain threshold to zero, effectively pruning weak connections.
Mimics biological neural adaptation and enhances computational efficiency.
is\_singular()
Checks for matrix singularity using the condition number.
If the condition number is above the threshold, the matrix is considered near-singular.
🔧 Customization
You can adjust the pruning threshold to experiment with different levels of neural connectivity:

```python
analyzer.synaptic_pruning(threshold=0.05)
🧠 Inspiration
Inspired by cognitive modeling and neuroscience, NeuroMatrixAnalyzer bridges the gap between biological neural networks and artificial intelligence. It's ideal for researchers and developers exploring adaptive neural systems.
